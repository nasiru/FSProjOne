Two separate projects for easier management.

Both will be able to send and receive instructions, but for now the Server will receive and the Client will send.

The sender will have a thread to process the instructions then send them one by one. 

Two ways to process the instruction:

1. Synchronous
  a. Sender - Send instruction (Threaded)
    b. Receiver - Receive and process instruction
    c. Receiver - Send "sync complete"
  d. Sender - Receive "sync complete"
  e. Sender - Get next instruction from queue, go to step a.

2. Asynchronous
  a. Sender - Send instructions at an interval (Threaded)
  b. Receiver - Receive instruction, put in queue and just keep processing (Threaded)

For the paper:
Consider the size of the queue. This is basically the same as HTTP GET 1.0 and 1.1 protocol.
